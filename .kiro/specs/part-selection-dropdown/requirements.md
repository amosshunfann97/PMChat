# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the part selection interface by replacing the current search functionality with a dropdown menu that displays all 41 available parts. This will improve user experience by providing immediate visibility of all options and eliminating the need for users to know part names in advance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all available parts in a dropdown menu, so that I can easily browse and select from the complete list without needing to search or remember part names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the part selection interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown menu containing all 41 available parts
2. WHEN a user clicks on the dropdown THEN the system SHALL show the complete list of parts including: Adapter, Adjusting Nut, Ballnut, Barrel, Bearing, and all 36 additional parts
3. WHEN a user selects a part from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL update the selection and proceed with the chosen part
4. WHEN the dropdown is displayed THEN the system SHALL show parts in a logical order (alphabetical or by category)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dropdown to be searchable/filterable, so that I can quickly find specific parts when the list is long.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the dropdown field THEN the system SHALL filter the visible options to match the typed text
2. WHEN filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL show only parts that contain the search term in their name
3. WHEN the search field is cleared THEN the system SHALL display all parts again
4. WHEN no parts match the search term THEN the system SHALL display a "No parts found" message

### Requirement 3

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dropdown is displayed THEN the system SHALL show each part name clearly with adequate spacing
2. WHEN a user hovers over a dropdown option THEN the system SHALL highlight the option with a visual indicator
3. WHEN a part is selected THEN the system SHALL display the selected part name in the dropdown field
4. WHEN the dropdown is closed THEN the system SHALL show only the selected part name or a placeholder text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dropdown to be accessible and keyboard navigable, so that I can use it efficiently regardless of my input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Tab THEN the system SHALL focus on the dropdown element
2. WHEN the dropdown has focus and user presses Enter or Space THEN the system SHALL open the dropdown menu
3. WHEN the dropdown is open and user presses Arrow keys THEN the system SHALL navigate through the options
4. WHEN an option is highlighted and user presses Enter THEN the system SHALL select that option and close the dropdown
5. WHEN user presses Escape THEN the system SHALL close the dropdown without making a selection
